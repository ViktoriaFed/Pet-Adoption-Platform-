# Pet Adoption Platform
Welcome to the Pet Adoption Platform, a simple backend project with PHP that allows users to view, filter, and adopt pets. This project includes CRUD operations for managing animal data, user registration and login systems, and an admin panel for managing pets.

##  Animal Display
All animals are displayed on the home page (home.php) with a user-friendly GUI.
## Senior Animals
A "Senior" link in the navbar allows users to view senior animals.
## User Authentication
User registration and login system. 
 - User Roles
Two user roles: Normal Users and Admin.
 - Normal Users can only view data; no CRUD actions are available.
 - Admin has access to the Admin Panel/Dashboard for CRUD operations.
## Admin Panel/Dashboard
Admin-only access to create, update, and delete animal data.
